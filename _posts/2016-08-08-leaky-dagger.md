title: Leaking Activities with Dagger
---

Dagger 1 or 2 is a dependency injection library that is highly touted by the intelligentsia of the Android development world.  I am not here to knock Dagger, but to point out (or to be pointed at) a missing step developers may be missing when using Dagger to inject the current Activity in different areas of code.  The standard way I have found of injecting Activities is done like this:
{% highlight js %}
public class StatusActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    ...
	
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_first);

        Dagger.getApplicationComponent().inject(this);
        Dagger.activateActivityComponent(this);

        ButterKnife.bind(this);
        setSupportActionBar(toolbar);
    }

    ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

It's an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.
